# Project Auth API

Using everything we have learned so far, we were asked to create an API with routes to login and register users, and finally an authenticated endpoint, in order to make a very basic web app which would display a simple message once authenticated.

## The problem

The problem was to create an authenticated endpoint which would return the appropriate error codes if you try to access it without a token, and to encrypt the passwords in the database with bcrypt. The user input should also be validated when creating a new user, and return error messages which could be shown by the frontend in a very simple way.

## What to add in the future

I would like to show error messages returned by user input in a nicer way, and make a more elaborate message when logged in.
